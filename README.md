The data files are stored seperately in Google Drive, because Github has a hard upload limit for data files.

Here are three data folder links:

1). NBER data:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pngaWa2FK5KrOZ2N3iLMMWaho-6aIqIc

2). Our data:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-8wT_ugbAkhLOqoa7jn7s8DtAXG_i7s8

3). regressions: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JMVliMHN57GnhWtwlkqfqBiOtf6-H7OH

Please download these datasets from the Google Drive links. Then the code from the Github would be able to run.
